Mahora Linux is a Linux Distribution based on Debian 10 Buster, designed to be a parody of Late 90s' Windows NT Workstation OSes (NT4 in particular) and 9x Era Windows, utilizing KDE Plasma, Reactionary, Chicago95 and other Era-appropriate theming and branding to mimic the aesthetic of Late 90s' Windows.

Much like AmogOS, Hannah Montana Linux and other "Parody" OSes, Mahora Linux also leans into a 'parody' of a hypothetical operating system developed by the "Mahora Academy Computer Society", a fictional non-profit software collective originating from Mahora Academy, a Japanese Academy (And associated city) originating from Mahou Sensei Negima!.
